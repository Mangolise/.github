## Mangolise

We are Mangolise, an Australia based, in-progress Minecraft server network made with [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom).

Our philosophy is to open-source all our gamemodes while keeping our network logic private. This means that anyone can run our games locally with no restrictions.
All of our gamemodes are licensed under MIT.

We hope to release soon!
